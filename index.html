                <h2>Welcome To Our Site</h2>
                <p>I am Ben Carling, the owner and head coach at Sports Performance Services Ltd, based in Douglas, Isle
                    of Man. After studying business management, I decided embark in a career that was also a passion of
                    mine; health and fitness. I had played sports from an early age so it seemed a natural thing to do.
                    I became a qualified Personal Trainer, and latterly an accredited Strength and Conditioning coach
                    with the UKSCA. Currently there are only 4 accredited coaches in the Isle of Man, and circa 600 in
                    the UK.

                    As well as private work, I work at the Isle of Man Sport Institute. I work with a wide cross section
                    of athletes from different sports, from field based sports such as football, rugby and hockey to
                    individual sports such as archery, sailing, tennis, motorsport and swimming. I am proud to have
                    played my part in helping these athletes set personal bests, Island records and some that have gone
                    on to achieve scholarships or youth contracts at professional level.</p>
